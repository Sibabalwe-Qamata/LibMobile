    <p>The LibraryFinder was founded and built by 4 Software Developers namely, Lihle Naphakade, Sibabalwe Qamata, Unalo Tshokotsha and Ayabonga Nompetsheni.
    <br>
    <br>
    The App aims to help and assist learners, students as well as community members by helping them to be able to access and find libraries closest to their locations based on the category of the library they are looking for.
    <br>
    <br>
    Below is a brief explanation of the above personas:
    <br>
    <br>
    - Learners are pupils who are still under basic education meaning they are still within Grade R - Grade 12. They are school kids who normally would visit the local/community libraries where they can access books fitting to their academic level.
    <br>
    <br>
    - Students are mostly people who are in the Tertiary level of studying or higher education. According to the City of Cape Town statistics, these students would most likely visit the Regional, Satellite or City-wide libraries in order to get books to suit their
    educational level. They can also find relevant books at any community library however, libraries which would be more helpful to them are as mentioned above.
    <br>
    <br>
    -Community Members or visitors is anyone in the community who is interested in reading or would like to empower themselves. Depending on the books they are looking for, these people can most likely visit all the library Categories.
    <br>
    <br>
    The LibraryFinder App is going to help all these three personas in accessing the libraries in order to save time, have quiet study time, be more advanced as well it will make their lives easier.
